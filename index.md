# About
The workshop on XXXX aims at bringing together researches, practitioners and industry who study the interpretability and debug of deep learning models.

The target user is the developer itself.
## Topics


The topics include but are not limited to:
- Interpretable/Explainable Deep Learning;
- XAI evaluation: how can we assess the quality of explanations and their effectiveness for debugging purpose? (e.g. metrics, protocols, etc.);
- Debugging via interpretability: How can explainable artificial intelligence help us in debugging deep learning models?
- Methods to identify and address sources and causes of failure (e.g.training data, regularization, objective functions, etc.);
- Visual analytics systems for understanding and debugging deep learning  models;
- Systematic analysis of limitations of current approaches.

## Tracks



**Regular track:**
Submission to this track have to be full papers of original work. Some of them will be selected as contributed talks, and other may be presented during a poster session or as spotlight papers, depending on schedule constraints.
For both these case, submissions must be presented by one of the authors (mandatory).

**We encourage the authors to link a repository containing the code to replicate the results inside the corpus of the paper.** While this is not a mandatory requiriment, it will be positively taken in account during the reviewing process and the selection of the contributed talks. 


Submissions must follow the NEURIPS paper format and guidelines (see XXXX) and they are limited to X pages, excluding references.
All accepted papers will be posted on the workshop website.
Papers submissions should be in the anonymized format of NeurIPS, and will undergo double-blind peer review.

We will not accept submissions that have been published previously in another workshop or other publication venue. We may consider paper that are simultaneously submitted to conferences or journals, provided that the authors declare the double submission in an additional page including information as the venue, the paper ID and the difference between the submitted versions.


**Mentorship track:**
The mentorship track pairs authors with experienced researchers who have committed to providing meaningful feedback to help polish papers for general submission. This program helps authors to get support and fast feedback from the research community facilitates a private dialogue between the mentee and mentor. 
The papers of this track have to be non-anonymous.
None of the papers submitted to this track will be presented or included in the workshop schedule.

**A glimpse of the future track:**
This special track aims at discovering and highlighting the most promising students in the field. The students will have the possibility to present their research plan to the community, describing the problems that they plan to address and possible research directions. Submissions for this track must include a research plan (max. 2 pages) and a cover letter from the current or future supervisor. This track is intended for first-year PhD students or prospective PhD students.
