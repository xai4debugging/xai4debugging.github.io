# **About**

Recently, the field of artificial intelligence has seen the explosion of deep learning models, who are able to reach super human performance, finding application in a lot of domains. The great performance comes at the cost of explainability: deep learning models are seen as black boxes where you feed an input and take an output without the possibility to retrieve the motivations behind that decision. 
The field of explainable artificial intelligence is trying to address such a problem proposing methods that can explain, at least partially, the behavior of these networks. Despite the growing literature on the topic, there are a lot of open problems in the field yet: from the definition of interpretability to the definition of valid metrics, from the study of users to the study of effectiveness of these solutions. In this workshop we try to reduce the scope on a more specific case, fixing the target user of these systems as the developer or the researcher. This type of user typically has a good knowledge about the models, but it needs to validate, debug, and improve them.

This is an important topic for several reasons. Domains like healthcare and justice require that experts are able to validate these models before deployment; development of novel deep learning model is dominated by trial-and-error phases guided by aggregated metrics and old benchmarks that tell us very little about the skills and utility of these models; and the debug phase is a nightmare for practitioners too. The workshop seeks to do a step forward in that direction collecting novel methods, and discussing challenges, issues and goals on the topic.

The scope of the workshop can be placed between the field of artificial intelligence, typically focused on proposing novel methods for explaining deep neural networks, and the computer science field, more interested at tracking and debugging models, like in the visual analytics case. The workshop aims at bringing researchers and practitioners of both the fields, reinforcing their collaboration.

## **Topics**


The topics include but are not limited to:
- Interpretable/Explainable Deep Learning;
- XAI evaluation: how can we assess the quality of explanations and their effectiveness for debugging purpose? (e.g. metrics, protocols, etc.);
- Debugging via interpretability: How can explainable artificial intelligence help us in debugging deep learning models?
- Methods to identify and address sources and causes of failure (e.g.training data, regularization, objective functions, etc.);
- Visual analytics systems for understanding and debugging deep learning  models;
- Systematic analysis of limitations of current approaches.

# **Call for Papers**

The call for papers includes three different tracks: regular track, mentorship track a glimpse of the future track.  The first one is the traditional track for presenting novel contributions. The second one is directed to young researchers and aims to pair a mentor and a mentee with the goal of polishing early-submissions. The last one is intended for first-year PhD student and MSc student working on the topic, giving them the possibility to introduce themselves and their research proposal to the research community.


## **Tracks**

### **Regular track:**
Submissions to this track have to be novel contributions covering any topic listed above. We don't accept work that has been already published, that is concurrently submitted to other venues, or that is presented at the main NeurIPS conference, including as part of an invited talk. We solicit submission of full papers, position papers, and papers describing open problems. 


**We encourage the authors to link a repository containing the code to replicate the results inside the corpus of the paper.** While this is not a mandatory requirement, it will be positively taken in account during the reviewing process and the selection of the contributed talks. Submissions must follow the NEURIPS paper, its anonymized format (see XXXX), and they are limited to X pages, excluding references. They will undergo double-blind peer review.

Accepted works will be presented as contributed talks or as posters in a poster session or listed on the workshop site as accepted contributions, depending on schedule constraints.
It is mandatory that at least one of the authors will attend the workshop and present its work during the contributed talks and the poster session. 
We are planning to include an additional virtual channel, like Slack, where each accepted paper will have a dedicated section where attendance and authors can discuss. We strongly encourage authors to be available on their section before, during, and shortly after the workshop.

Submission deadline: 11:59 PM CEST, Sep 15, 2021

Notification Date:  11:59 PM CEST, Oct 20, 2021

### **Mentorship track:**
The mentorship track pairs authors with experienced researchers who have committed to providing meaningful feedback to help polish papers for general submission. This program helps authors to get support and fast feedback from the research community facilitates a private dialogue between the mentee and mentor. 
The papers of this track have to be non-anonymous.
None of the papers submitted to this track will be presented or included in the workshop schedule.

### **A glimpse of the future track:**
This special track aims at discovering and highlighting the most promising students in the field. The students will have the possibility to present their research plan to the community, describing the problems that they plan to address and possible research directions. Submissions for this track must include a research plan (max. 2 pages) and a cover letter from the current or future supervisor. This track is intended for first-year PhD students or prospective PhD students.
